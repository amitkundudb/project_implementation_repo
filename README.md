**Project Implementation Repository** 

This repository contains code and documentation for various stages of data processing and transformation workflows. The primary focus is on ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, unit testing, and documentation. The repository is structured to facilitate easy navigation and understanding of each step in the workflow.

**Repository Structure**
source_to_bronze:
Scripts and processes for extracting data from source systems and loading into the bronze (raw data) layer.

bronze_to_silver:
Transformation scripts to clean and standardize data, moving it from the bronze layer to the silver (processed data) layer.

silver_to_gold:
Further data enrichment and aggregation to prepare data for analytics and reporting, transitioning it from the silver layer to the gold (analytics-ready data) layer.

confluence_documentation:
Documentation and notes related to the project, including design decisions, data dictionary, and process flows.

unittesting:
Unit tests for validating the functionality and correctness of the ETL processes.
